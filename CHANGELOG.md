# 2.0.1 (2018-04-03)

The whole project has been upgraded to run via angular-cli and package with ng-packagr. This required a lot of changes to the structure of therefor a whole new version.

The package now also uses the latest version of `rxjs` with the pipe operator. Also it requires the latest beta version of angular to run.
